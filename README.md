# netbox2unomaly

## What it currently does

The current scope is somewhat limited in its functionality. Any extensions or
additions are very welcome.

1. Creates groups in Unomaly based on Netbox racks/rackgroups (groups/subgroups)
2. Pulls info on all systems from Unomaly
3. Matches the systems from Unomaly and adds them to the Netbox groups.
